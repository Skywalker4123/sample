When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"
